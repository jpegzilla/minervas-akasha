# contributing:

minerva's akasha is very well commented and soon to be very well documented. I aim to make it extremely easy to create additions / modifications to this application (given you know javascript / sass / html). once this software reaches beta, I hope that some people will develop useful additions / plugins for it.

if you want to contribute to minerva's akasha, do this 8-step process:

1.  fork this repository and clone the repo onto your computer
2.  add this repo as an upstream to that repo: `https://github.com/jpegzilla/minervas-akasha.git`
3.  get latest changes:
```
git checkout master
git fetch --all
git merge upstream/master
```
4.  install all deps: `yarn install`
5.  create a feature branch from my master branch
6.  make the feature / fix / whatever and commit the changes to your own branch
7.  make a pr from your branch to my master.
8.  I will review it and merge it if the change is acceptable. done!

also, it doesn't hurt to talk to me about things you want to add to minerva's akasha. I can easily be contacted on discord at `jpegzilla#6969` or on twitter `@jpegzilla`, or email me.
